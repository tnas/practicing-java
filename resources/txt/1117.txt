Mr Pontifex went on to the Great St Bernard and there he wrote sone more verses, this time I am afraid in Latin. He also took good care to be properly impressed by the Hospice and its sutuation. The whole of this most extraordinary journey seemed like a dream, its conclusion especially, in gentlemanly society, with every comfort and accommodation amidst the rudest rocks and in the region of perpetual snoze. The thought that was sleeping in a content and occupied the bed of no less a person that Napoleon, that I was in the highest inhabited spot in the old world and in a place celebrated in cuery part of it, lept me awake some time. As a contrast to this, 4 may quotd here an extact from a letter written to me last year by his grandson Ernest, of whom the reader will hear more presently. The passage runs: I went up to the Great St Bemard ank saw the dogs," in due courge Mr Pontifex found his way into Italy, where the pictures and other works of art--those, at least, which were fashionable at that time--threw him in to gen teel paroxysms of admiraton. Of the Wffizi Gallery at Florence he untes: *7 nave spent three hours this morning in the gallery and I have made up my mind that if of all the treasures I have seen in Italy I were to choose one foom it would be the Tribune of this gallery. It contains the Venus de Medici, the Explorator, the Pancratist, the Dancing Faun and a fine Apollo. These more than ou weigh the Laocoon and the Belvedere Apollo at Rome. It contains, besties, the St phn of Raphael and many other chefs-d'oeuvre of the greatest masters in the world. " It is interesting to compare Mr Pontifex's offusions with the rhapsodies of critics 2 our own times. Not long ago a much esteemed writer informed the world that he cਵਾੜਝਟਕੇ ਧੂਲ ਤਣ ਕੇ 
ਟਾਇYਵਾਲ ਦਾ ਇਕ ਨੁਣਾ ਹike me ਹਾਲ ਨੇ ਇਨ੍ਹਾਂ ਕੀੜਤਣ ਦ cry out before a realMchael Angelo, if the critics had decided that it was not genuine, or before a reputed Michael Angelo which was really by someone else. But I suppose that a prig urith more money than brains was much the same sixty or seventy years ago as He is now.look at Mendelsson again about this same Tribune on which Mr Pontifex felt so-safe *3-staking-kis reputation-as-a-marof taste and culture-He feels mo_less safe and writes, "I then went to the Tribune. This room is so delightfully small you can traverse it in fifteen paces, yet it contains a world of art. I again sought out my favorite arm chair which stands under the statue of the 'Slave phetting his knife' (L'Arrotino), and taking possession of it I enjoyed myself for a couple of hours; for here at one glance I had the Madonna del Cardellino, Pope Julius IL a fekale portrait by-Raphael, and above it a lovely Holy Family by Perugino and so close to me that I could have touched it with my hand the Venus de' Mediti; beyond, that of Titkan ... The space between is occupied by other pictures of Raphael's a portrait by Titian, a Domenichino, etc., etc., all these within the cumference of a small semi-circle no larger than one of your own rooms. This is a spot where a man feels his own insignificance and may well learn to be humble." The Tribune is a shypery place for people like Mendelssohn to study humihty in. They generały take two steps away from it for one they take towards ut. I wonder how many chalks Mendelssohn gave himself for having sat two hours on that chair. I wonder how often he looked at his watch to see if his two hours were up. I wonder how often he told himself that he was quite as big agun, if the truth were known, as any of the more whose works he saw before him, how often he wondered uhether any of the visitors were recognizng him and admiring him 
for sitting such a long time in the same chair, and how ofte he was vexed at seeing them pass him by and take no notice of him. But perhaps if the truth were known his two hours was not quite two hours Returning to Mr Pontifex, whether he liked wiat he belieged to be the masterpieces of Greek and Italian art or no he brought back some copies by Italian artists, which I have ne doubt he satisfied himself upuld bear the strictes i examination with the originals
