if Trisha was there, that could be awkward, but Maggie couldn't deny Henry. "I stay long enough to see that you're home safely." She hugged him td her. "I'll go call your dad and tell him I'll bring you home." "Okay, guess," he said, looking as dejected as she'd ever seen him. When Maggie returned from phoning a relieved Erit, Henry stood and slowly pulled a crumpled envelope from his jeans porket. "For you," he said, holding it out to het: She withdrew a lacy greeting card from the envelope and only with steel control did she keep from bursting into tears. On the outside of the card in a flowery script were the words "For one who is like a mother to me." She couldn't speak Only a hug would do. Huddled in the passenger seat, Henry didn', speak until they'd stopped in Eric's driveway. "I wish you were niy mother Maggie parked, then turned to the pale-faced boy. "Thank you. If I had a son, I'd want him to be just like 
you "Do I hafta go in? "You know the answer. Keep an open mind. She might surprise you." "Okay, he said, climbing from the tab. On the way up the walk, he slipped his hand into hers, a poignant plea for moral support Eric threw open the door. Cathering Henry in his arms, he said, "Son, I've been so worried." Beyond the two othem, Maggie could see a tall, slender woman with fashion-model good looks standing with her hands clutched together. Maggie approached father and son. "I'll be going now." But hefore she could stoop to hug Henry, he uttered an explosive "No!" hnd wrapped his arms around her waist. "You can't go. You promised." Eric caught her eye with a helpless gaze. "Henry I said I'd bring your home, but now He faced his father defiantly. "I'm not going in without Coach." Maggie wanted to run. She had no role in this unfolding drama, no experience to tell her what to say or how to act. "Eric, I'm sorry I don't know where he got the idea that Eric shushed her. "It's okay. Maybeleven better if you come in." "Please!" Henry embraced her again. He was trembling, and when she cupped his face in her hands, he felt feverish. Maggie closed her eyes, seeking clarity. She may have no experience, but she did have a lot of love for this little boy. Hopefully that would be enough to guide her. "Okay, Henry, I'll come in, but just for a few minutes." 
Eric put his arm on the boy's shoulder. "I'll be right here with you, buddy." The three of them entered the living room. Trisha, this is my friend Maggie. And Henry." He gently shoved his son forward. Maggie held her Greath. Thisha crumpled onto the edge of the sofa. "Oh, Eric, he's so big." She held but her arms. "Henry, would you come sit with me?" 
It was then Maggie noticed that Henry had losed his eyes and was refusing to look at his mother. "Henry "Eric inte vened. "Can't yor say hello?" Like a wet dog emerging from a pond, Henry shook his head violently back and forth.
