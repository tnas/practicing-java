Nevertheless a certain kind of good fortune generally attends self-made men to the last is their chldren of the first, or first and second generation who are in greater danger for the rece can no more repeat its most successful perfomances suddenly and without its ebbings and flowings of success than the individuud can do so and the more brilliant the success in any one generation, the greater as a generad ride the subsequent échalstION util time las been a lowed for recovery. Hence it offens happens that the grandson of a sudcessid man will be more successful than the sort the spirit that actuated the grandfather fraving lain fallow in the son and being refreshed by repose so as to be ready for fresh exertion in the grands. A very successfid man moreover, at something of the hybrid in him, he is a new animal, arising from the coming together of mary unfamiliar elements and it is well known that the reproduction of a termal growths, wieder animal or vegetade, is irregular and not to be depended upon, even when they are not absolutely sterile. And certaily Mr Pontifex's success was exceedingly rapid. Only a few years after re had become a parter his unde and at both died within a few months of one another. It was then found that they had made from their heir. He was us not only sole partner in the business but found himself with a fortune of some $0,000 pounds into the bargain, and this was a large sun in those days. Morey came pouring in upon hin, and the faster it came the fonder te became of it, though, as he frequently said, he valued it not for its own sake, but only as a means of providing for his hearchildren Yet willen a man is very fond of his mortay it is not easy for him at all times to be very fond of his children also. The two are like God and Mammon. Lord Macaulay has e passage in which he contrasts the pleasures which a man mo, derive from books with the inconveniences to which he may be put by us dcquaintances. "Plato,' he says, "never sullen. Cervantes is never petulant. Demostheses never comes upkeasonably. Dante rever stays bo long. Na difference of political opinion canalienate Cicero, Wo heresy canexcise the horror of Bossuet." I dare sa-I might differ from Lord Macaulay in my estimate of some of the wrters he has ramed but there can be no disputing his main proposition, namely that we need have no more trouble from any of them than we have a mind to, whereas our frends are not always so easily disposed of. George Pontifex felt this as regards his children and his mchey. His money was rever naughty; his money never made noise ar litter, and did not spill things on the tablecloth at meal times or leave the door open when it went out. His dividends did not quarrel amorg themselves, or was he under any uneasiness lest his mortgages should become extravagant on reaching manhood and run hi up debts which sooner or later he sidud have to pay. There were tendencies in Jom which made him very uneasy, and Theobald, his second son, was ide and at times far from trichfil. His chidren might, perhaps, have answered, had they known what was in their father's mind, that he did not knock his more about as he not frequently knocked his children. He meter dealt hastily or petishly with his money, and that was perhaps y he and it got on so well together. It must be remembered that at the beginning of the nineteenth centudy the relations between parents and children were still far from satisfactory. The violent tpe of father, as described by Fielding, Richardson, Smollett and Sheridan, is now hardly more lkely to find a place in literature than the original advertise nent of Metsrs.

The purers 77 Miss Azzsten's novels are less like savage wild beasts than those of her predecessors, but she evidently looks upon them with suspicion, and at weasy feeling that le pere de famille est capable de tout makes itself sufficiently apparent throughout the greater part of her writings. In the Elizabethan time the relations between parents and children seem on the whole to have been more kindly. The fathers and the sons are for the most part friends in Shakespeare, nor does the evil appear to have reached its id) abomination till a long course of Puritanism had familidrised men's minds with Jewish isleals as those which we should endeafour to reproduce in our everyday life. What precedents did not Abraham, Jep than and Jonadat the son of Rechas offer? How easy-was-it te-quote-ald follow them in an age when few reasortable men or women doubted that every syllable of the Old Testament was taken down verbatim from the mouth of God. Moreovet Puritarism restricted natural pleasures; it substituted the Jeremiad for the Paean, and it forgot that the poor abuses of all times wart countenance. Mr Pontifex may have been a little sterer with lis children than some of his reighbours, but not mud. He threshed his boys trio or three times a week and some weeks good deal ofteren but in those days forkers were always training their boys.
