That single sliver of light illuminated a mon adorned in fur and feathers. He sat there, his eyes closed and his mouth open, bredthing the earthen air as he beat his hands 412.a tiny drum. In the infinite space below the ground, the beats travelled forever into the emptiness. Pam stood transfixed. The light illuminated the shaman's face just right, casting eerie shadows into his mouth and beneath his eyes. She flinched when he opened his eyes, seeing her for the first time. 
The heating of the drum ceased. Pam looked down to see that his hands were empty, the drum lost to the darkness. He regarded her with an intense glare. The room was full of a heavy stillness that pressed into Pam's body so hard she fell to her knees, panting for air. The shaman spoke words Pam didn't understand, muddy words that clumped and rolled off of his tongue in syllables that Pam couldn't place. Staring deep into her eyes, the shaman helt something up. Pam recognized it as the pot she had thrown into the ravine. "Anasazi." It was the one word she understood. He tapped the pot meaningfully and then faved one hand into the darkness. Sounds of terror and sadness filled the air and Pam covered her ears to shut out the notse. The Shaman held the pot in her face and shook it with angel: “Anasazi!" He shouted and cast the pot at her feet. She looked down and realized the ground was gone beneath her.

Panicked, she rolled out of bed, tearing at the thing covering her fade Genic yowled as he was unceremoniously tossed from the bed and he disappeared around the corner, as if that was where he was heading all along Two months to the day had passed. Every night ended the same, with a rolling examination of the black and white pot, listening to the soft shuffling within It was October now and the first big showstorm of the vear had hit Sitting in her chair wearing an old oversized sweater from an ex boyfriend, she held the pot in her hands and gazed outside into the night sky. In the last two months, things had begun to change for Pan. The guilt of her act had slowly begun gnawing away dt her conscience. Frequent trips to the grocery store had grown further and further apare as casual looks from other shoppers had begun to feel like pointed accusations. Het shopping hours were now in the early midmorning Hours, aitay from prying eyes. Avoiding phone calls from her few friends and family alike, her time at home was now spent with that cursed pot. Evenings were spent hypnotically tracing those damned black lines as they sunk into squares and Hades of glass. Some nights it felt almost hot to the touch. Staring deep into her eyes, the shaman helt something up. Þam recognized it as the pot she had thrown into the ravine
