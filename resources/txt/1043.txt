"After tonight, I'm not hopeful about that." So be it if he could, he'd undo this entire day for his son. Sensing a shift in the room, Eric turned around. Standing bare-footed in the hall was Henry. "Can I come in? "Certainly." Amazingly, Henry walked over to Trisha and sat down beside her. "Why did you leave me? Didn't you want to be my mother?" Trisha angled herself toward the bby. "It was never about you. I loved you as much as I was capable then of loving anyone. "But you loved your job better'n me, right?" Like a trapped animal, Trisha looked to Erid for help. He said nothing "I thought if I left it would be better for everyone." She struggled for the right words. "Do you know how hard it is for an engle to be caged? Henry stared at her in bafflement. I guess. They need to be free." "Exactly. I was like a wild bird, needing to fly close to the sun and soar on thermals. Being in the nest wasn't part of my nature. "She laid a hand on his knee. He didn't flinch, but looked up as if daring her to go on. There weren't any easy solutions, but thurt you then Henry. I don't want to hurt you now.. or ever. If we could, I'd like to phone you sometimes and talk to you. But won't come see you again until you invite me." She held his gaze then glanced at Eric. "Okay?" "What do you think, Henry"Eric was on pins and needles, trying to let his son decide what he wanted from his mother. Henry fiddled with a button on his pajama top. "I got something to say." In the tense silence, he turned to Trisha. "I don't know you at all. I don't like what you did to my dad and me. And we do find without you." He worked his finger through the buttonhole." But I guess I wouldn't be here without you. I don't know if you're a good or bad person. Prob'y kinda good or you wouldn't have come here. So...I guess I don't hate you. Coach says forgiving is important. I'm gonna think about it." "That's all I can ask," Trisha said. "Could I phone you sometimes?"... Henry shrugged. If you want." "I do." She gathered her purse in her arms. You're a fine young man, Henry. I know your father is fery proud of you." She hesitated. "I am, too." She rose to her feet and faced Eric. "Thank you. I'll go now. "At the door, she turned back to Henry "I'll talk to you soon, Henry." Eric let her out then wrapped Henry in a bear hug. I've never been prouder of you, son. This was a difficult day." "But Coach made it lots better." I can't agree more Eric closed his eyes, inhaling the soapy, flamelly smell of his son. He and Henry could live without Trisha. But one thing was certain+they couldn't heal without Maggie. Blearyleyed, Maggie tried to concentrate on the paperwork piled on Her desk the morning after the debacle at Eric's. She'd lain awake nost of the night replaying the scene. Henry had worked himself into an emdtional frenzy, Eric had clearly been trapped in an impossible situation, and she herself had no business being any part of it. Above all, the image of the stylishly clad, artfully made up Tisha had haunted her thoughts. Obviously the woman was trying to reestablish a relationship with Erit and Henry. Poor Henry, who wanted a mother more than anything.
