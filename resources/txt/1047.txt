Shoviny aside the drafts of the recenter monthly calendar, she staret out the prindow at the gathering rain clouds. Henry's Mother's Day card had touched her to the core. Yet the sentinlent had nade her uncomfortable, especially in light of Trishd's appearance. Irrational as she knew it might be, she couldn't help comparing herself to Trisha. There was a world of difference between the woman's traveted, chto appearance and her own blue jean-and-sweatshirt wardrobe. If Trisha had attracted Eric at one point, there was no way he could ind an outdoor gir like her interesting. Besides, Henry needed time and space to reconnect with his mother. No matter how much she cared for Henry+and Eric+it didn't seem fair to put herself between them and a possible reconciliation with Trisha. And yet, was bowing out, ruming away, only her way of retreating behind herold defenses? The ring of her phone interrupted her thoughts. Checking the caller ID, she saw it was Eric. She let the call go to the answering machine. She couldn't face him until she got herself straightened out. When his voice filled the room, she gripped the arms of her chair. Maggie, I'm sorry you're not there. I wanted to thank you for helping with Henry last night. You were a godsend. He felt better this morning and even went to school. Any chande you'd be free after work? I need to talk to you. Call me Her stomach churned. Undoubtedly he wanted to break it off with her Whatever "it" was. She mentally kicked herself. Diumb, dumb, dumb for a long time she'd succeeded in protecting herself from the trauma of romante. Now she was knee-deep in it, and it hurt But that was the price of risking, and in the end, she wouldn't go back to the way she'd been living. On her laptop, she pulled up the website for the Colorado outdoor leadership school. Pristine mountains, rushing trout streams, Alpine flowers. All night she had tried to talk herself into accepting the position there Bottom line, she'd grown way too attached to Eric and Henry Wouldn't the unselfish decision be to step back and let them work on bonding with Trisha? Maggie had often heard it said that when one door closes, you need a new door And that door had been offered to her at exactly the right moment. But was going to Colorado her way of closing the door on a life with Eric and Henry? She realized that taking the job would be the easy way out. And she'd never been a roward She picked up the phone to call her friend in Colorado tater that afternoon she was in the gym setting up potteybelt rets when Chrad terraby stopped by: "There's a rumor going around that you were talking about a job transfer. What's going on?" 1 One of the joys of small town—you could never kep anything a secret. "A friend offered me a very tempting job in Colorado and I was considering it "What: I'm stunned. You're such an important part of this community." He shook his head in disbelief "Wow. Have you said anything to Eric?" "No, I couldn't phone him until I knew what was in my heart." And, Mdggie realized, her heart had known what it wanted all along. Eric glanced at the clock for the umpteenth time. Henry would be home from the rec center soon, and Maggie still hadnt returned his call. Was she avoiding him? Had something happened? Last night had made everything clearer. Trisha would never be the involved, day-to-day mother Henry needed. More important, he'd realized that Maggie was nothing like Trisha. Maggie had handled the situation with grace. He would never forget how tenderly she had cared for Henry, tucking him into bed with a kiss.
