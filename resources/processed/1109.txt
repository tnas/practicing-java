two before she died, but we could never make it as she did. When we were children she used sometimes to send her respects to my mother, and ask leave for us to come and take tea-with-her- Right well she used to ply us. As for temper we never met such a delightful old lady in our lides; whatever Mr Pontifex may have had to put up with, we had no cause for complaint and then Mr Poni fex would play to s upon the organ, and we world stand round him Open mouthed and think uim the most wonderfully clever man that ever was born, except of course our papa. Mrs Pontifex had no sense of humour, at least 1 dan call to mind ng signs of this, but her husband had plenty bf fun in him, though few would have guessed it from his appearance. I remember my father once sent me down to his works hp to get some glue, and I happened to come when old Pontifex was in the act of scolding his boy. He had got the lad-a pudding-headed fellow-by the ear and was saying, "What Lost again--smothered o' wit." (I believe it was the boy who was himself supposed to be a wandering soul, and who was thus addressed as lost) "Now, look here my lad, he continued, "someboys are bom stupid, and thou art one of them some achieve stupidity-that's thee again, Jim-thou wast both born stupid and last greatl increased thy birthright--and some" (and here came a climax during witch the boy's head and ear were swayed from side to side) have stupidity thrust upon them, which, if it please the Lord, shall not be the case, my lad, for will thrust stupidity from thee, though I have to bo. thine eats in doing $0," but I did not see that the old man really did box Jim's ears, or dd more than pretend to frighten him, for the two understood one another perfectly well. Another time I remember hearing him call the village rat catcher by saying Come hither, thou three-days-and-three-nights thou, alkı ding, as Nafterwards learned, to the rat catcher's periods of intoxication; but I will tell ne more of such trifles. My father's face would always brighter when old Pontifex's name was mentioned. "I tell you, Edward, 1 he would say to me, "old Pontifex was not only an able man, but he was one of tile very ablestmen that ever I knew." | This was more than I as a young man was prepared to stad. "My dear father," I answered, "what did he do? He could draw-a-dile, but could he to save his to have got a preture into the Royal Academy exhibition? He built-two organs and could play the finuet in Samson on one and the March in Scipio on the other; he was a good carpenter and a bit of a wag he was a good old fellow enough but why make him out so much abler than he was?" "My boy "retumed my fathet, "you must not judge by the work, but by the work in connection with the surroundings. Could Giotto of Filippo Lippi think you, eve got a picture into the Exhibition? Would a single one of those frescoes we went to see then we were at Padua have the remotest chance of being tung if it were sent in forexhibtion now? Why, the Academy people would be sd outraged that they would not even write to poor Gotto to tell him to come and take his fresco away. Phew! continued he, waxing wara, "ifold Pontifex had fuad Cromwell's chances he would have done all that Cromwell did, and have done it better; if he had had Giotto's chances he would have done all that Chotto-didand done it no worse as it tras, hews-a-village carpenter and I will undertaketo-say-kve never scamped a joc in the wible course of his life." "But, said I, we canno judge people with so many 'ifs. Ifold | Pontifes had lived in Giotto's time he right have been another Giotto, but he did not lue in Giotto's time." 
"I tell you, Edward," said my father with some severity, we must judge mer not so much by what they do, at by what they make us feel that they hate it in them to do. If a man has done enough either in painting, music or the affairs of Afe, to make me feel that I might trust him in an emergency he has done enough. It is not by what aan has actually put upon his canvas, nor yet by the acts which h has set down, so lo speak, upon the canvas of his le that I will judge him, but by what he makes me feel that he felt and aimed dt. If he has made me feel that He felt those things to be loveable which I hold loveable myself 1 ask no more; Mis grammar may have been imperfect, but still have understood him; he and I are en rapport; and I say again, Edward, that old Pontifex was not only anable man, but one of the very ablest men I ever knew. Against this there was no more to be said. And my sisters eyed me to silence. Somehow, or other my sisters always did eye me to silence when I differed from my father.
