was assured, with conviction deeper than she could have attained by any argument founded upon were reason "We, dearest Theobald," she exclaimed "will be ever faithfid.

"Dearest Theobald " exclaimed Christina, drying the tears that had gathered in her eyes, you are always, always rigit.bet us be selfderying, mire, tupright, th: i-word and deed." She casped her hands and tooked up to Heaven as she spoke. "Dearest," rejoined her lover we have ever hidterto endeavoured lo be all of these things, we have not been worldly people, let us watch and pray that we may so continue to the end." The moon rad risen and the arbour was getting damp, so they adjourned further aspirttions ford more convenient season. At other times Christina pictured herself and Theobald as braving the scom of almost eveby human being in the achievement of some mighty task which should redound to the honour of her redeemer. Se cada pace anything for dus. But aways towards the end of hersion there came a litte coronation scene high up in the golden regions of the Heavens, and ddiadem was set upon her head by the Son of Wan Himself, amid a host of angels and archangels who looked on with enw and dmiration--and here even Theobald himself was out of it. If there could be sich a thing as the Mormon of Righteousness Christina would have assuredly made friends with it. Her papa and manina were very estimable people and would in the course of time receive Heavenly Mansions in which they would be exceedingly confortable so doubdess would her sisters; so perhaps, even might her brothers; but for herself she felt that a higher destiny was preparing, which it was her duty never to lose sight of. The first step towards it would be her marriage with Theobald. In spite, however, of these flights of religious romanticism, Christa was a good-tempered kindly matured girl enough, who, if she had married a sersible laym02,we will say a hotel-keeper-would have developed into a good landlachy and been deservedy popular with her guests. Such was Theobald's engaged life. May a little present passed between the pæir, and may a small surprise did they prepare pleasantly for one another. They never quarrelled, and neither of them ever flirted with anyone else. Mrs 
Allaby and his future sisters-2-law ido ised The bald in spite of its being impossible to get another deacon to come and be played for as long as Theobald was able to help Mr Allaby, which now of course he did free gratis and for nothing; two of the sisters however did manage to find insbands before Christina was actually married, and on each occasion Theobald played the part of decoy elephant. In the end only owo out of the seven daughters remained

After three or four years, old Mr Pontifex became accustomed to his son's engagement and looked upon it as among the things which had nowapreso riptive right to toleration. In the spring of 1832, more than five years after Theobald had first walked over td Crampsford, one of the best livings in the gift of the College unepectedly fell vacant, and was for various reasons declined by the two fellows senior to Theobald, who might each have been expected to take it. The living was them offered to and of course accepted by Theobald, being in value not less than 500 pounds a year with a suitable house and garden. Oid Mr Pontifex then came down more handsomely than was expected and settled 10,000 pound on his son and daughter-in-law for life with remainder to such of their issue as they might appoint. In the month of Ly, 1831 Theobald and Oristina decame man and wife. Ale number of old shees had been thrown at the carriage in which the happy pair departed from the Rectoby, and it had turned the corner at the bottom of the village. It could then be seen for two or three hundred yards creeping past a fir coppice, and after this was lost to view. "John, said Mr Alfaby to his man-senant, "sing the gate " and he went indoors with a stigh of relief vich seemed to say: "I have done t, and I am alive." Thuis was the reaction after a burst ofent musiastic merriment during which the old gentler an had nun twenty yards after the carriage to fling a slipper at it--which he had duly flung.
