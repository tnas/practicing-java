cresistance Theobald would not have vertured to swagger with her but she was not a Barbary hen, she was only a common en andrat too-with-rather smaker share of persoral-traver-the-tens generally have. Battersbt-On-The-Hill was the name of the village of which Theobd awas now Rector. It contained 400 or 500 inhabitants, scattered over a rather large area, and consisting entirely of farmers and agriaudaural labourers. The Recton was commodious, and placed on the brow of a hii which gave it a delightfud prospect. There was a fair sprinking of neighbours with in visiting range, but with one or two exceptions they were the clergymen and clergymen's families of the surrounding villages. By these the Portifexes were welcomed as great acquisitions to the neighbourhood. Mr Pontifex, they said was so clever he had been senior classic and senior wrangler; a perfect genius in fact, and yet with so much sound practical common sense as well. As son of such a distinguished man as the great Mr Pontifex the publisher he would come into a large property by-and by. Was there not an elder brother? Yes, but there would be so much that Theobald would probably get something very considerable. Of course they would give direr parties. And Mrs Pondjex, what a charming woman she was she was certainly not exactly prey perhaps, but then she had such a sweet smile and her marr was so bright and wiming. She was so devoted too to her husband and her lusband to her they really did come up to one's ideas of wirat lovers used to be in days of old, it was rare to meet with such a pair in these degenerate times; it was quite beautifid, etc., etc. Such were the comments of the neighbours on the new arrnas. As for THEODUIT'S TWIPOSTSİR ORTS, the farmers HETE CITE U tzt labourers and their wives obseq ious. There was a little dissent, the legacy of a careless predecessor, but as MS Theobald said prady, "I think Theobald may be trusted to deal with THAT." The church was then an interesting specimen of late Norman, with some early English additions. It was what in ditese days would be called in a very bad state of repair, but forty or fity years ago few churches were in good repair. If there is one feature more characteristic of the present generation than another it is that it has been a great restore of churches Horace preached durch restoration in his ode: Delicta majorum immerius lges, Romane, doned templa refeceris Aedesque labentes deorum et Foeda nigro simulacra fumo. Nothing went right with Rome for long together after the Augustan age, but whether it was because she did restore the temples or because she did not restore them I now not. They certainly went all wrong after Constantine's time and yet Rome is still a cry of some importance. I may sky here that before Theobald hd been many years at Battersby he found scope for use fill work in the rebuilding of Battersby church, which he carried out at considerable cost, towards which he subscribed liberally himself. He was his own architect, and this saped expense; but architecture was not very well understood about the year 1834, when Theobald commented operations, and the result is not as satisfactoby as it would have been if he had waited a few years longer. Every man's work, whether it be literature or music or pictures or architecture or anything else, is always a portrait of himself and the more he tries to conceal himself the more clearly all his character appear in spite of him. I may very likely le cordemning myself, all the time that I am writing this book for I know that whether I like it or no I am portraying myself more surely than I am portraying any of the characters whom I set before the reader. I am sorry that it is so, but I camd help it--after which sop to Nemesis I will say that Battersby church in its amended form has always struck me as a better portrait of Theabad than any sculptor or panter short of a great master would be able to produce. I remember staying with Theobald some sic or seven months after he was married, and whie the old church was still standing. I went to cherch, and felt as Nagnan must have felt on certain occasions when he had to accomparty his master on his return after having been cured of his leprosy. I love carried away a more vivid recollection of this and of the people, than of Theobald's sermon. Een now I can see the men in blue smock frocks reaching to their heels, and more than one old woman ing scarlet d'oak; the tow of stolid, dill, vacant plough boys, ungairly in build, uncomely in face, lifeless, apathetic, a race a good deal more like the pre-revolution French peasant as described by Carlyle than I pleasant to reflect upona race now supplanted by a smarter, comelier ord more topefil generation, which has discovered diat it too has a right to as much happiness as it cant get, and with clearer ideas about the best means of getting it.
