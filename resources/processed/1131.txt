pregnant with serious consequences to yourself? Did there lurk a treat under these words--though it was impossible to lay nad of it or of them? Were they not intended to prowce at the effect of a threat without being actually threatening?" 
Theobald kraw his father wel enough to be little likely to misapprehend his meaning, but having ventured so far on the path of opposition, and being really arecious to get out of being ordained if he could, he determined to venture farther.

He accordingly wrote the following: "My dear father,-- ou tell me and I heartly thank you--that no one will compel me to be ordained. I knew you would not press ordinatich upon me if my conscience was seriously opposed to it; I have therefore resolved on giving up the idea, and believe that if you will continue to allow me what youdo at present, until I get my fellowshp, which showd not be long, I will stienceuse puffvig you tofiutier apene. I will make up my mind as soon as possible wiat profession I will adopt, and will let you know at once.—Your affectionate son, THEOBAID PONTIFEX."

The remaining letter, written by return of post, must now be given. It has the merit of brevity. "Dear Theobald.--I have received yours. I am at a loss to conceive its motive, but am very clear as to its effect. You shall not receix a single sogence_fron me fill you come to your serises. Shauld youex.ct in your fdly and wickedhess, I am happy to remember that I have yet other children whose conduct I can depend upon to be a source of credit and happiness to me. Your affectionate but troubled father, G. PONTIFEX." I do not know the immediate sequel to the foregoing correspondence, but it all came perfectly right in the end. Either Theobald's heart died him, or he inte preted the outward shove witch his father gave hin, as the inward call for which I have no doubt he prayed with great eamestness-- or he was a firm belever in the eficacy of braver Abd so am I under certain circunstances. Terviyson has said that more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of, but fre has wisely refroined from saying whether they are good things or bad things. It might perhaps be as well if the woda were to dream of, or even become wide awake to, some of the things that are being wrought by praver. But the question is avovedly difficult. In the end Theobald gon his fellowship by a stroke of luck very soon after taking his degree and was ondared in the autumn of the same year 1825. Mr Allany was rector of Crampsford, a village a few miles from Cambridge. He, too, had taken a good degree, had got a fellowship, and in the course of time med accepted a college living of about 400 pounds a year and a house. His private income did not exceed 200 pounds a year. On resigning his fellowship he married a woman a good deal younger than hinself who bore him eleven children, nine of whom--two sons and even daughters--were living The two eldest daughters had married fairly well, but at the time of which I am how writing there were still fie urmarried, of ages varying benveen thirty and owenty-two-and the sons were neither them yer of their father's hands. It was plain that if anything were to happen to Mr Allaby the family would be let poorly off, and this made both Mr and Mrs Alldby as unhappy as it ought to have made them. Reader did you ever have an income at best none too large, wluich died with you all except 200 pounds a year? Did you ever at the same time have two sons who must be started in life somehow, and five daughters still umarried for whom you would only be too thankful to find husbands--if you knew how to find them morality is that which on the whole, brings a man peace in his declining years-if that is to say, it is not an utter swindle, can youunder these circumstances flatter yourself that you have led a moral lie? And this even though your wife has been so good a woman that yay have not grown tired of her, and has not julen into such il health as lowers you own health in sympathy; and though your family has grown up vigorous, amiable, and blessed with common sense. I know many old men and women who are reputed moral, but who are living with partners whom they have long ceased tolove, or who haveugly disagreeable maider daughters for whom they have never been able to find usbands daughters whom they loath and by whom they are loathed in secret, or sons whose folly or extravagances a perpetual wear and worry to them. Is it mord for a man to have brought such things upon himself? Someone should do for orals wirst that old Pecksnif Bacon las obtained the credit of having done for science, But to fetuto and its Alfaby its Atlaby talked about having married two of her daughters us throughriad been the easiest thing in the world. She talked in this way because she heard ther mothers do so, but in her heart of
