not get on with him for long together. He said I had no reference; whereas I thought that I had plenty of reverence for what deserved to be revered, but that the gods which he deemed golden were in reality made of basert metal. He never, as I have said, complained of his father to me, and is only other friends were, like himself, staid and prim, of evangelical tenderties, and deeply imined with a sense of the sinfidness of any act of insubordination to parents--good young nen, in fact and one cannot blow off steam to a good young man. When Christina was informed by her lover of his father's opposition, and of the time which must protably elapse before they could be married, she offered--wih how much sinceroy I know not--to se him free from his engagement, et Theobald declined to be released "nog at least, "las he said, "at present." Christina and its Allaby khew they could manage him, and on this not very satisfactorypating the engagement was continued. His engagement artthis refizsai to be released or once raised Theobald in his own good opinion. Dili as he was, he had nosmall share of quiet self-approbation. He admired him self for his Universiy distinctich, for the purity of his life (1 said offrim once that if he lead only a better temper he would be as mocent as a new-laid egy) and for his wimpeachable integrity in money matters. He did not despair of advancement in the Church when he had once got a living, and of toure it was within the bounds of possibility that he might one day become a Biskop, and Christina said she elt convirted that this would ltimately be the case. As was natural for the daughter and intended wife of a clergyman, Christina's thoughts ran much upon religion, and she was resolved that even though an exalted position in this world were denied to her and Theobald their virtues should be idly appreciated in the next. Her religious opinions coincided absolutely with Theobald's awn, and many a corrvertation did she have with him about the glory of God, and the completeness with which they would devote themse ves to it, as soon as Theobaldlad got his living and they were married. So certain was she of the great results which wordd then ensue that she wondered at times at the blindness shown by Providence towards its own truest interests in not killing off the rectors who stood between Theobald and his living a little faster. In those days people believed with a simple downrightness which I do not observe among educated men and women now. I had never so much as crossed Theobald's mind to doubt the literal accuracy of any syllable in the Bible He had never seen any book in which this was disputed, nor met with armore who doubted it. Fre, there was just 
a little care about geology, but there was nothing in it. If it was said that God made the world in six days, wiry He did make it in soc days, neither in more no less; if it was said that He put Adam to sleep, took out one of his ribs and made a woman of it, wlp it was so as a matter of course. He, Adam, went to sleep as it might be himself, Theobald Pontifex, in agarden, as it might be the garden at Crampsford Rectory during the summer months when it was so preby, only that it was larger, and had some tame vild animals in it. Then God came up to him, as it might be M: Alaby o his father, bexterously took out che of his ribs without waking him, ana miraculously healed the wound so that no trace of the operation remained. Findly, God had taken the rib perhaps into the greenhouse, and had turned it intojus such another young woman as Christina. That was how it was done; there was neither difficulty nor shadow of difficulty about the matter could not God do anything He liked, and had He not in His own-inspired Book told us that He had done this? This was the average attiude of fairly educated young men and women towards the Mosat cosmogpray füty: forty, or even twenty years ago. The combating of infideliny, therefore, offered little scope for enterprising young clergymen, mor host the Church awakened to the activity which she was since displayed among the poor in our large towns. These were then left almost without an effort at resistance of co-operation to the labours of those who had succeeded Wesley. Missionary work indeed in heathen countries was being carried on with some energy, but Theobald did not feel any cal to be a missionary Christine suggested this to suim more than once, and assured tim of the unspeakable happiness it would be to herto be the wife of a missionary, and to share his dangers, she and The boald might even be martyred, of course they would be martyred simidtaneously, and martyrdom many years hence regarded from the arbour in the Rectory garden was not painfid, it would ensure them a gloriok_ture in the bent world and at any_mate pastinyx ous Imophin this evenifthey were not miraculous restored to life again, and such things had happened ere now in the case of martyrs. Theobald, however, had not been
