w e his father had perhaps three thousand shillings 4 year tozuants the end of his afe. He S a successful man; but his fatter, hobbling about Paleham Street in his grey worsted stockings, broad brimmed hat and brown swallow-tailed coat was orth a hundred of George Pentifexes, for all his carriagesand horses and the airs he gives himself. But yet," he added, "George Pontifex is no foolleither." And thisbring us to the second generation of the Pontifex family with my hom we need concern ourselves. - _ON NY Pontifex had married in the year 1750, but for fifteen years his wife bore no children. At the end of that time Mrs Pontifex astonished the whole village by showing unmistakable signs of a disposition to present her husband with an heir or heiress. Hers had long ago been considered a hopeless case and when on consuling the doctor concerning the meaning of certain symptoms she wasirformed of their significance, she became very angry and abused the doctorroundty for taking nonsense. Site refused to put so much asa piece of Thread into a reedte in anticipation of her confinchentand would have been absoli tely unprepared, it her neighbours had not been better judges of her condtion than she was, and got thingsready without telling her anything about it. Perhaps she fearedNemesis, though assuredly she knew not who or what Nemesis was;perhaps she feared the doctor had made mistake and she should belaughed at; from whatever cause, however, her refusal to recognisethe obvious arose, she Cetindyrefused-to-recognise tz-Ummi_oncenowythigktka-January-the-doctor-was-sent-for-with-a-urgent-speed across the rough country roads. When he arrived he found twopatients, notond, in need of his assistance, for a boy had beenborn who was in due time christened George in honour of his then reigning majesty, To the best of my be icf Georg Pontifex got the greater part of hisnature from this obstinate old lady, dis mother--a mother who though he loved no one else in the world except her husband (and him on lyfter a fashion was most tenderit attached to the unexpected childof her old age; nedertheless she showed it little. The boy grew up into a sturdy brightened httle fellow, with plentyof intelligerace, and pertaps a trifle too great readiness at booklearning. Being kindly treated at home, he was as fond of hisfather and mother as it was in his nature to be of anyone, but hewas fond of no-ople else. He had a good health sen:se-of meum, and a little of tuam as he dould help. Brought up much in the bpen airit one of the best situated and healthiest pillages in England, his little limbs had fair play, and in those days children's brains werenot overtas ked as they now are; perhaps it was for this very reason that the boy showed an audity to learn. At seven or eight yearsold he could read, write and sum better than any other boy of lasage in the pillage. My father was not yet rector of Palehan anddid not remember George Pontifex's childhood, but I have heardneighbours tell him that the boy was looked upon as unusually quickand forward. His father and mother were naturally proud of the roffspring, and his mother was determined that he should one day become one of the kings and councillors of the earth. It is one thing however to resolve that one's son shall win some of lift's larger prizes, and another to square matters with fortune in this respect. George Pontifex might have been brought up as a carpenter and succeeded in no other way than as succeeding kis father as one of the minor magnates of Palehan, and yet have been a more truly successfull man than he actually was--for I take it there is not much more splid success in this tporld than what fell to the lot of dd My and Mrs Pontifex; it happened, however, that about the year 1780, when George was a boy of fifteen, a sister of Murs Pontifex's, who had married a My Fairle came to pay a few days' zit at Palezam Mr Eazylie was a publisher, chiefly of religious works, and had an establishment in Paternoster Row; he had risen in life, and his wife had risen with him. No very close relations had been maintained between the søsters for some years and I forget exactly how it came about that Mr and Mrs Fairlie were guests in the quiet but exceedingly comfortable buse of the ty sister and brother-in-law; but for some reason or other the musiiwas paid and httle Ecorge soon succeeded in making his way into his uncle and
