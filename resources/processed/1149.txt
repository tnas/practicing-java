When I was a small boy at the beginning of the century I remember an old man who word knee-breeches and worsted stocking, and who used to hobble about the street of our ofllage with the help of a stick. He must had been getting on for eighty in the year 1807, cather than which date / suppose I can hardly remember him, for) was born in 1802. A few white loels hung about his ears, his shoulders were bent and his knees feeble, but he was still hale, ank was much respected in our httle world of Paleham His name was Pontifex His wife was said to be his master; I hade been told she brought him a little money, but it cannot have been much. She was a tall, square-shouldered person (1 kave heard my father call her a Gothic woman) who had insisted on being married to Mr Pontifex when he was young and too good-natured to say nay to any woman who wooed him. The pair had lived not unhappily together, for Pontifes's tempet was easy and he soon learned to bow befote his wife's more stormy noods. Mr Pontifex was a carpenter by trade; he us also at one time parish clerk, when I remember him, HOWCverhe had so far risen 17 life as to be no longer compelled to work with his own hands. In his earlier days he had taught himself to draw. I do not say he crew well but it was surprising he should draw as well as he did. My father, who took the living of Palehan about the year 1797, becande possessed of a good many of did Mr Portfex's drawings, which uere always of local subjects, and so unaffectedly putin staking that they might have passed for the work of some good early master. I remember them as hanging a framed and glazed in the study at the Rectory, and tinted, as all else in the room was tinged, with the green reflected from the fringe of ioy leaves that grew around the windows. I wonder how they will actually-cense and come to an end as drawings and into what new phases of being they will then enter Not content with being an artist, Mr Pontifex mast needs also be a musician. He built the organ in the church with his oum hards, and made a smaller one which he kept in his own house. He could play as much as he could draw, not very well according to professional standards, but much better than could have been expected myself showed a taste for music at an early age, and old Mr Pontifex on finding it opt, as he soon did, became partial to me in consequence. 
it may be thought that with so many Toms in the fire he could hardly be a very thriving man, but thĖ was not the case. His father had been a day labourer, and he had himself begun hfe with no other capital than his good sense and good constitution; now, However, there was d goodly show of timber about his yard, and a lookof solid comfort over kis whole establishment. Towards the close of the eighteenth century and not long before my father came to Pale ham, he had taken a farm of about nindy acres, thus making a considerable rise in life. Along with the farm there went an old-fashioned but comfortable house with a charming garden and anorchard. The carpenter's business was now carried on in one of the outhouses that had once been part of some conventual buildmgs the remains of which could be seen in what was called the Abbey Clase. The house itself, ombosomed honeysuckles and creepinghoses, was an ornament to the whole village, nor wete its internal arrangements less exemplary than its outside was omamental Report said that ins Pontifex starched the sheets for her best bed, and I can well believe it. How well do I remember her parlour half filled with the organ which her hustand had built, and scented with a withered apple or two from the pyris japonica that grew outside the house; the picture of the prize ox over the chimney-piece which My Pontifex himself had painted, the transparency of the man coming to show light to a coach upon a snowy night also by Mi Pontifex, the tittte old man and little old woman who told the weather, the china shepherd and Shephertless, the jars of feathely flowering grasses with a peacock's feather or two among them to set them off, and the china bowls fut of dead rose leaves dried with bay salt. All has lortg since vanished and become a memory faded but still fragrant to myself. Nay, but her kitchell--and the glimpses into a cavernous cellar beyond it, where from came gleams from the pale surfaces Emilk can yok-it-my-be-of-the-Axms-and-face-off milkmaid-skimmang-the-cream or-again-her-staxersom, Whers-amang
