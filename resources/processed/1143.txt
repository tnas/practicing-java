But witut were the feelings of Theobald and Christina when the village was passed and t'tey were rolling quiety by the Firplevitation is at this point that even the contest Heart Attai, tantess it beetintae breent of one to river head and ears in love. If a young man is in a small boat on a choppy sea, along with his fianced bride and both are sea-sick, and if the sick swair can forget his own anguish in the happiness of holding the fair one's head when she is at her woist-then he is in love, and his heart will be in no danger of failing him as he passes his fir plantation. Other people, and unfortunately by far the greater number of those who get married must be ckessed among the "other people," will inevitably go through a quarter or half an hour of greater or less badness as the case mo be. Taking mumbers into account, I should think more mente suffering had been undergone in the streets leading from St George's, Hanover Square, than in the condemned cells of Newgate. There is no tme at which what we Italians call la figlia della Morte lays her cold hand uponla man more awfully than during the first half hour that he is alone with a woman whom he has married but never gernely loved. Death's daughter did not spare Theobald. He had behaved very well hitherto. When Christina hod ofered to let him go, he had stuck to his post with a magnanimid on which he had plumed himself ever since. From that time forward he had said to himself T, atarly rate, am the very soud of honour; I am not," etd, etc. Thie, at the moment of magnanimity the actual cash payment, so to speak, was still distant; when is father gave formal consent to his marriage things began to look more serious; when the college living had fallen vacant and been accepted they looked more serious still; but when Christina actually named the day, then Theobald's heart fainted within hin. The engagement had gone or so long that he had got into a groove, and the prospect of change was disconcerning. Christina and he had got on, we thought to himself, very nicely for a great number of years, why--why--why should they not continue to go on as they were doing now for the rest of their lives? But there was no more chance of escape for him than for the sheep which is being driven to the butcher's backpremises, and like the sheep he felt that there was nothing to be gained by resistance, so he made none. He behaved, in fact, with decency, and was declared on dl hands to be one of the happiest men imaginable. Now, however, to change the metaphor, the drop had actually falen! and the poor Wretc I was hanging in mdair along with the credure of his affections. This creature was now thirty three years old, and looked if she had been weeping, and her eyes and nose were reddis: if "I have done it and I am alive," was written on Mr Allaby's face after he had thrown the shas, "I have done it, and I do not see how I can possibl, live much longer" was upon the face of Theobaldas he was being driven along by the fir Plantation. This, however, was not apparent at the Recten. All that could be seen there was the bobbing up and down of the postilion's head, which just over-topped the hedge by the roadside as he rose in his stirnips, and the black and fellow body of the carriage. For some time the pair said nothing: what they must have felt during their first half hour the reader nust guess, for it is beyond my power to tell him at the end of that time, however, Theobald had rummaged up a conclusion from some odd comer of his soul to the effect that now he and Christina were married the sooner they fell into their fiture mutual relations the better if people who are in a difficulty will only do the first little reasonable thing which they can clearly recognise as reasonable, they will always find the next step more edsy both to see and take. What, then, thought Theo ald, was here at this moment the first and most obvious matter to be considered, and wiat would be an equitable view of his on Christina's relative positions in respect to it? Cearly thelr first dier was their first joint entry into the duties and pleasures of married life. No less clearly it was Christine's duty to order it, and his own to eat it and pay for it. The arguments leading to this conclusion, and the conclusion itse, jashed upon The bald about tree and a half miles after he had left Crampeford on itke road td Newmarket. He had breakfasted early, but his usual appetite had 
failed dim. They had left the vicarage at noon without staying for the wedding breakfast. Theobald liked an early dinner; it damed upon him that he was begiming to be hangbr: from this to the conclusion stated in the preceding paragraph the steps had been easy. After a few minutes' further reflection he broached the matter to his bride, and thus the ice was broken. Mrs Tileobald was not prepared for so sudden an assumption of importance. Her nerves, never of the stronges had been stug to their highest tension by the event of the moming. She wanted to escape observation; she was collSCIOUS of looking a little dder than she quite liked to look as a bride who had been married that morning; she feared the 
landacy, the chamber-maid, the water-- everybody and everything her heart beat so fast that she could thardly speak, much less go through the ordeal of ordering dinner in a strange hotel with a strange labdacshe
