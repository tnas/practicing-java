o overlook Before his visit was over My Fairlie proposed to the lad's father and mother that he should put him into his ਧਾਤੂES, ਝਾੜ ਵੀ ਆre Tੜਾ ਲਵਾਯੂ ਦਾਣੇਵਾ ਲਾਕਰਾ Exਯਾਦrce 
forward Mrs Pontifex had her son's interest too much at heart to refuse such an offer, so the matter was soon artanged, and about a fortnight after the Fairlies had left, Glorge was sent up ly coach to London, where he was met by his uncle and aurdt, with whom it was arranged that he should live, This was George's great start in life. He now wone more fashionable clothes than he had wet been accustomed to, and any little rusticity of gait or pronunciaron which he had brought from Paleham, was so quickly and completely lost that it was ere long impossible to detect that he had not beer bom and bred among people of what is commonly called education. The boy paid great attention to his work, and more than justified the favourable opinion witch Mr Fairlie had forged concerning him. Sometimes Mr Fairls would end him down to Paleham for a few days' oliday, and ere long his parents perceived that he had acquired an air and manner of talking different from any that he had taken with non from Palehane. They were proud of tim, and soon fell into their proper places, resigning all appearance of a parental control, for which indeed there was no kind of necessity. It retum, George was always kindly to them, and to the end of his life retained a more affectionate feeling towards his father and mother than I imagine him ever to have felt again forman, Woman.Jor Chia Georges visits to Paleham were never long, for the distance from London was under fifty miles and there was a direct coach, so that the jou mey was easy; there was not time, therefore, for the novelty to wear of either on the part of the young man or of his parents. George liked the fresh country air and green fields after the darkness to which he had been so-long accustomed in-Paternoster Row whick-then, As-HOW, WS-a-arrow-gloomy-lane rather than a street Independently of the pleasure of secing the familir faces of the farmers and villagers, he hiked also being seen and being congratulated on growing up such a fint-looking and fortunate young fellow, for he was not the youth to hide his light under a bushel. His uncle had had him saught Latin and Creek of an evening; He had taker kindly to these languages and had ragdly and easily-mastered what many-boys take wears-in-aequirme suppose his knowledge gave him a self-confidence which made self felt hether he intended it or not; at any rate he soon began to pose as a judge of literature, and from this to being a judge of art, architecture, music and everythirag else, the path was easy. Like his father, he knew the value of money, but he was at once more ostentatious and less liberal than his father while yet a boy he was a thorough little man of the world, and di well rather upon principles which he had ested by personal csomeone else's being put away into the churchyard; we presed, therefore, in a short time from extreme depression to a no less extreme exultation, a new heaven and a new carth had been revealed to us in our perception of the possibility of benefiting by the death of our friends, and I fear that for some time we took an interest in the health of everyone in the village whose position rendered a repetition of the dole in the last likely. Those were the days in which all great tungs seemed far off, and we were astonished to fired that Napoleon Buonaparte was an actually livkg person. We had thought such a great man could only hape lived a very long time ago, and here he was after all almost as it were at ourown door. This leat colour to the view that the Day of Judgement might indeed be nearer than we had thought, but nurse said that was all right nou, and she new. In these days the snow lay| 
longer and drifted deeper in the lanes than it does now, and the mill was sometimes brou ht in frozer' in wintet, and we were taken dowr into the back kitchen to see if I suppose there are rectories up and down the country now where the mill comes in frozen sometimes in vinter, and the children go down to wonder at it, but I never see any frozen milk in London, so I suppose the winters are warmer than they used to be About one year after his wife's death Mr Pontifex also wa gathered to his fathers. My fatker saw her the day before he died. The old man and a theory about sunsets, and
