When I was a small boy at the beginning of the century I remember an old man who wore knee-breeches and worsted
stockings, and who fused to hobble about the street of our village with the help of a stick. He must have been getting on
for eighty in the year 1807, earlier than which date I suppose I can hardly remember him for I was born in 1802. A few 
white locks hung about his ears, his shoulders were bent and his knees feeble, but he was still hale, and was much 
respected in our little world of Palehan. His name was Pontifex.

His wife was said to be his master; I have been told she brought him a little money, but it cannot have been much. She 
was a tail, square-shouldered person (I have heard my father call her a Gothic woman) who had insisted on being 
married to Mr Pontifex when he was young and too good-natured to say nay to any woman who wood him. The pair
had lived not unhappily together, for Mr Pontifex temper was easy and he soon learned to bow before his wife's more 
stormy moods. Mr Pontifex was a carpenter by trade; he was also at one time parish clerk; when I remember him, 
however, he had so far risen in life as to be no longer compelled to work with his own hands. In his earlier days he had 
taught himself to draw. I do not say he drew well, but it was surprising he should draw as well as he did. My father, 
who took the living of Paleham about the year 17oz, became possessed of a good many of old Mr Pontifex's drawings, 
which were always of local subjects, and so unaffectedly painstaking that they might have passed for the work of some 
good early master. I remember them as ranging up framed and glazed in the study at the Rectory, and tinted, as all else 
in the room was tired, with the green reflected from the fringe of leaves that grew around the windows. I wonder 
how they will actually cease and come to an end as drawwings, and into what new phases of being the will then enter. 
Not content with being an artist, Mr Pontifex must reeds dso be a musician. He built the organ in the church with his 
own hands, and made a smaller one which he kept in his own house! He could play as much as he could draw, not very 
well according to professional standards, but much better than-could have been expected. I myself slowed a taste for 
music at an early age, and old Mr Pontifex on finding it out, as he soon did, became partial to me in consequence. 

It may be thought that with so many irons in the fire he could hardly be a very thriving man, but this was not the case. 
His father had been a day labourer, and he had himself begun life with no other capital than his good sense and good 
constitution, now, however, there was d goodly show of timber about his yard, and a look of solid comfort over his 
whole establishment Towards the close of the eighteenth century and not long before my father came to Paleham, he 
had taken a farm of about ninety acres, thus making a considerable rise in life. Along with the farm there went an old-
fashioned but comfortable house with a charming garden and anorchard. The carpenters business was now carried on 
in one of the outhouses that had once been part of some conventual buildings, the remains of which could be seen in 
what was called the Abbey Close.
 
The house itself, embosomed in honeysuckles and creeping roses, was an ornament to the whole village, nor were its 
internal arrangements less exemplary than its outside was ornamental. Report said that Mrs Pontifex starched the 
sheets for her best bed, and I can well believe it. How well do I remember her parlour half filled with the organ which 
her husband had built, and scented with a withered apple or two from the pyrus japonica that grew outside the house;
the picture of the prize ox over the chimney-piece which Mr Portifex himself had 
painted, the transparency of the man coming to show light to a coach upon a snowy night also by Mr Pontifex the 
little old man and litlle old woman who told the weather, the china shepherd and shepherdess; the jars of feathery 
flowering grasses with a peacock's feather or two among them to set them off, and the china bowls full
of dead rose leaves dried with bay salt. All has long since vanished and become a memory, faded but still fragrant to 
myself. 

Nay, but her kitcher-and the glimpses into a cavernous cellar beyond it, where from came gleams from the pale 
surfaces of milk cans, or it may be of the arms and face of a milkmaid skimming the cream; or again her storeroom, 
where among other treasures the kept the famous lipsalve which was one of her especial glories, and of which she 
would present a shape yearly to those whom she delighted to honour. She wrote out the recipe for this and gave it to my 
mother a year or two before she died, but we could never make it as she did. When we were children she used 
sometimes to send their respects to my mother, and ask leave for us to come and take tea with her. Right well she used to 
ply us. As for temper, we never met such a delightful old lady in our lives; whatever Mr Pontifex may have had to put 
up with, we had no cause for complaint and then Mr Pontifex would play to us upon the organ, and we would stand 
round him open-mouthed and think him the most wonderfully clever man that ever was born, except of course our 
papa.
